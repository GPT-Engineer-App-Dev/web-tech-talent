# web-tech-talent

Implement a landing page for a marketplace called Particles that connects companies with software talent. The page should have the following sections:

- Hero section with a catchy headline and subheading explaining the key benefits 
- How it works section with 3 steps: 1) Search for talent 2) Review profiles 3) Contact developers
- Call-to-action button to "View developer listings"

Use a modern, professional design with a tech-focused color scheme. Include relevant imagery related to software development.
